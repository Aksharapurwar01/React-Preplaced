# HOC

In React, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component.

Benefits

Reusability: HOCs allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components, which can save time and reduce code duplication.
Flexibility: HOCs can take additional arguments, which allows you to customize the behavior of the HOC. This makes them a flexible way to add functionality to your components.
Separation of concerns: HOCs can help separate concerns in your code by encapsulating certain functionality in a separate component. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
Composition: HOCs can be composed together to create more complex functionality. This allows you to build up functionality from smaller, reusable pieces.
Higher-order components can be used to implement cross-cutting concerns in your application such as authentication, error handling, logging, performance tracking, and many other features
